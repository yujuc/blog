I will use "Life Report" as the title when I want to talk about my recent life and thought. For whoever caring about me, just come check if there's any update! After few years, I can also look back and might realize how dumb I was ðŸ˜‚

## Reading

After getting my Kobo eReader, I can kind of utilize my spare time for reading. 

Now still reading my first book: "A Promised Land" from President Obama. I just finished Part1, it's mainly about his family and life background before he was involved in politics. The time he is working as a politician was shorter than I thought! Illinois state legislator â†’ US Senator â†’ US President! Back then he thought he was influential, and people around him also told him, this is a rare chance! Probably once in a life! Having more experience as a Senator doesn't ensure you can become a better president (so why not join the election now). The podcast I'm listening to also mentioned that some parts of this book are too positive. I think he was talking about this Part1 LOL

This reminds me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/catturd2/status/1334469144427814912?s=20). Obama said, he might take a shot of coronavirus vaccine on TV for inspiring people, and someone retweet with comment "narcissist". That was so funny but at least he is the former president US, with a huge amount of supporters. (might still have influence ðŸ¤”)

## I spend most of my time doing random stuffs

Recently I start using Google Calendar to record what I did. Except working and sleeping, most of the time is used for random stuffs... I really need to block at least an hour to focus on something. (like watching Netflix, playing Switch... those things are very easy to focus on ðŸ¤­). It's hard to complete something without concentration. So that most of my tasks are not even on the half way ðŸ˜¢

Random stuffs like eating, washing dishes, doing laundry, tracking spending, etc., are necessary in life. They only cost very little time but it's still a lot if you sum them up. Unless someone do those work for you, everyone has to face to it in the whole life. At my high school age, I mainly focus on study. So who did those random stuffs for me? (probably my parents ðŸ˜…). Of course I did eat and take shower by myself, but they don't make me feel like I was spending so much time. Maybe if you can focus on something more important, those random work will become minor. For example, when you are busy at work, you still need to eat or wash dishes, but you don't feel like "only doing random stuffs". 

You should always have something you are really into it.

## First cold in 2020

Hopefully it's also the last time. (What else, it's already year-end LOL). Probably because of Covid, I didn't really get sick this year. The sympthoms of covid are similar to normal cold, so my body doesn't want to be recognized as covid patient. Also because I use mask when I am outside, there's less chance to be infected by any other virus. It's said that this year in Japan, the number of influenza cases also decreases (compared with last year, it's 55000 â†’ 171 cases!!) Life style makes such a big difference! Because the ways covid and influenza spread are similar.

So why I still get cold? ðŸ¤§ I guess because I went to a mountain. It was like 5 degree at 7:30 AM when I arrived at the trailhead. Even I kept my jacket on all the day, I took off my mask and hat when it gets warmer. We headed back down to the trailhead at 4:00 PM, which means I was exposed in the cold environment for 8 hours ðŸ¥¶ 

Anyway it's not a big deal. Just sore throat and coughing (luckly no fever).

## What do I want

I hate myself for not being able to commit into something. Learning laguage, exercise habit, coding, Udemy courses, also what I'm doing now - writing blog. I don't know how long this will last. I think I don't really know what I want. There are so many things I want to try, but only achieve very little progress. (Miss your productive high school again?). I also read many productivity books or articles, but the point is how much determination I have?
