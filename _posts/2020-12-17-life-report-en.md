# Always wanna learn some skills for solving everything 🥷🏻

I am studying frontend and Docker recently.

For frondend development, it's mainly about React. I also need the visuailzation skill for work, like building simple frontend apps with React + Material UI. I sitll don't know about backend. Without backend, I can not build website with data or complicated calculation, but only fancy appearance.

I always wanna learn some skills, for solving everything. For example,

- When it comes to frontend development, it's always React
- For backend development, it's always Django (just an assumption)
- Design or RWD (Responsive web disign), just use Material-UI
- Database goes for MongoDB
- Hosting is Heroku
- Version control is Github
- etc etc

So it doesn't cost too much to learn many tools (actually, still a lot to learn 😢), the skills can be reused and no need to pay for different resources.

# No one likes RBF 😕

```
[Edit Note]

For RBF here, I planned to say a not-happy face, and I found the expressions online saying RBF (resting bitch face) or long face. Please let me know if there's better expression.
```

When I feel down, I might prefer to staying alone. I don't want to cause trouble to others. No one likes RBF. People who loves you can tolerant you, but it's also consuming their energy at the same time. So I hope I don't completely rely on others.

I was very depressed last week. If there has to be a reason, it's probably the weather and cold. I suddently felt no hope in my life.

And suddenly I recovered. Maybe I need to experence something different. I need to feel the change, feel that I'm still moving on.

# First snowboarding in this season 🏂 (2020/12/13)

I went snowboarding in Marunuma highland in Gumma. The tempeture was like 2˚C, but it doesn't feel that cold because we were moving all the time. For reaching the ski resort, you can either drive a car or join a bus tour. The moment I got on bus, I felt regretful, because I realized I have to stay with strangers in a close space for many bours... Although I came back safely and healthly, I will avoid joining any bus tour next year. If I want to go somewhere which can only be accessed by but tour, then I should just give up.

Anyway. When we arrived at the ski area, it was snowing slightly, but the view in front of us was dry grass converd with a thin layer of snow... 😱 Actually we had to take the lift to go higher. However, the snow was surprisingly nice! Maybe there's always artifitial snow spitting out XD There were only 3,4 routes open (maybe that's less than half), so it took so long lining up for the lift. I only skiied for four rides, fell few times, and evoke my muscles' memory. Next time I should spend at least two days.

# Dye my hair to blue 💙

I always want to try blue. Not like shiny cosplay style, but low-key, cool blue. The barber was not too surprised (maybe it's common), he just showed me the samples. But unexpectedly, I need to bleach my hair first before dying into blue! So it was my first time bleaching my hair 😖 (technically, fade my hair color into blonde, like bad teenagers XD) After bleaching, he put on the blue dye. But I think he made it too dark, so none of my friend realized I changed my hair color... Anyway, I hope the dark blue will fade out and become more obvious cool cool blue.

# Smile-with-tear Emoji 🥲

This emotion is probably hard to see without zoom in XD I found this smile-with-team emoji accidently.

According to [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/smiling-face-with-tear/)，it means touchfu or，relieved. The emotion is slightly different from "cry of joy" (😂). Compared with "😂" cry-of-joy, I prefer this "🥲" smile-with-tear. Maybe it matches my personality more.

```
[Edit note]: This emoji can also mean "smiling through pain" 🥲😭
```

I like emoji, even created [Twitter account for posting emoji](https://twitter.com/emojieveryday1) (Not updating often tho 😂)
