# What is this blog for?

Just for recording my life, my thought, my notes (language, programming, travelling... etc).

# How I made this blog

### STEP1: Make a simple blog with Jekyllrb
Follow the [Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). And it already looks nice (without knowing anything about Ruby 😁 ). 

### STEP2: Adjust to the style of "no style, please"
Mainly Follow this [instrction](https://jekyll-themes.com/no-style-please/#github-pages-installation)). But I slightly modified some steps:

- In `Gemfile`
    - Add `gem "no-style-please", "~> 0.3.1"`
    - Modify `gem "jekyll", "~> 3.8.7"`
- Add `theme: no-style-please` to the file `_config.yml`
- Run `bundle`
    
I assigned the version of "no-style-please" to Gemfile, because the default version is 0.1.0, which doesn't apply the latest change. And the Jekyll version also has to be changed accordingly.

### STEP3: Custimize your menu 
Create `_data/menu.yml`. I refer to the [sample](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please/blob/master/_data/menu.yml) from the author

### STEP4: Overwrite the defaul layout
The default templates perform slightly different. So I added this two files
Adding two files

- `_includes/menu_item.html`
- `_includes/post_list.html`

 Actually I also copied from the author's github　😛

### STEP5: Create archive pages
This is the page when you click something like "Read More...". First you need the html as a template, then a markdown file will actually create the archive page.

- `_layout/archive.html`
- `archive.md`

### STEP6: Push to Github and enable Github Page
Follow Github Page instruction.
